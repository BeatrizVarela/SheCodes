# INTRODUCTION

SheCodes was started in late 2017 in Lisbon, Portugal. The aim is to teach women
how to code to work towards decreasing the gender gap in the tech industry.
Matt Delac originally intended to teach only 10 women how to code. However, in
the first workshops, the students loved the idea of SheCodes much more than
Matt couldâ€™ve imagined.

I had my first SheCodes class on **September 15th, 2018**, and each class was
held once a week, for four weeks. All classes were given at Second Home, at
Time Out Market - Mercado da Ribeira, Lisbon.
